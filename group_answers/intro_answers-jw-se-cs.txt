1) Will ontologies work for you?

Yes: 
1) Extraction of anatomical characters from literature (CS).
2) More advanced search capabilities
3) Global community formal understanding of biodiversity concept and their relationship to each other

No:
1) Hard to part out the world according to explicit methods. 
2) Only if the semantics aren’t well understood yet.
3) Unclear how it won’t...I need to learn more (CS).

2) What data structures are current or potential proxies for ontologies in your world?
