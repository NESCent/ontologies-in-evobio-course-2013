Will an ontology work for me?
Yes
1. Relatively controlled vocabulary for subgroups, like a genus for example
2. Pool of expert and authoritative users that coordinate informally in small groups. Experts tend to specialize in small taxonomic groups like genera or families.
3. Boundaries can be set to limit content and set achievable goals, such as limiting to a specific taxon.
No
1. Vocabularies can change across the entire group (microbial eukaryotes versus dinoflagellates versus a specific genus). The terms applicable to one genus may not apply to another.
2. Coordination between and among experts and users is poor, especially between subgroups. There is no formalized structure for collaboration.
3. Much is still unknown about microbial eukaryotes, which leads to instability in the knowledge structure as new discoveries are made. Large upheavals in taxonomic and phylogenetic structure happen relatively frequently.
What data structures can be used as proxies for ontologies?
There are some lists available in publications. There are some small parts of existing ontologies that might be useful. No good central source.
