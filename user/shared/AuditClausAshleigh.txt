 Outstanding - Doe we want provide specific queries / site? Modify site list.  We have 1 hour, 5 minutes / site is >> 1 hr.  Are these the "most important" sites?
 Remember:  Karen will present open tree, and Jim will present Phensoscape KB

Start with slide with discussion of "Reference, Application, and Domain" ontologies. How are they mixed together? What is the mix called?  Does it matter?

Reference ontology - a data standard for building ontologies "all other classifications are useless"
   - strategies for modellings

= Ontologies, Evolution, and Web-based Resources =  

We have identified a number of different web-based portals, all of which have important usages for Evolutionary Biologists.  Some of these portals integrate/use ontologies, others do not.  

The goals of these exercises are the following:

* Raise awareness as to the sites themselves, and their potential use in evolutionary studies.
* Teach participants to identify when ontologies are being used.
* Illustrate mechanisms of integrating ontologies. 

== Sites ==

BHL: http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/
Bioportal: bioportal.bioontology.org
Dryad: http://datadryad.org/
Flybase: http://flybase.org/ 
GBIF: http://www.gbif.org/
MGI: http://www.informatics.jax.org/
Morphbank: http://morphbank.net
NIF: http://www.neuinfo.org/
OLS: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/
Ontobee: www.ontobee.org
TAIR: http://www.arabidopsis.org/
Virtual Fly Brain: http://www.virtualflybrain.org
ZFIN: http://zfin.org/

== Exercise ==

# For HALF of the sites above (choose based on your interest) consider the following questions.
In a text file, saved to your user SVN folder, answer the questions like so:

Ontobee: www.ontobee.org
1: yes/no
2: some answer
3: some answer
4: some answer
<you can also add answers to from the "bonus" questions if you choose>

Commit your file named 'audit.txt' to SVN when you have finished:

# !! After completion, find, and add your own site, with answers in the same format, to your text file.  
We will summarize the added sites this evening.

== Questions ==

1) Does this site use one or more ontologies?
Morphbank - no - could use CARO and image tagging and annotation for semantic enrichment.
DRYAD - no - could use Annotation Ontology to annotate resources associated with what is uploaded to DRYAD
Virtual Fly Brain - yes, uses brain ontology from Fly Base.  People can contribute to that ontology via OBO (maybe). 
MGI uses at least Mammalian Phenotype Browser, Gene Ontology.  It is not obvious how to contribute to Mammalian Phenotype Browser.
OLS - yes, it is an ontology aggregator.  They do not provide mechanisms to contribute to the underlying ontologies.
NIF - yes, it uses NIFSTD Ontology.  They are experimenting with a moderated semantic wiki as a way for users to contribute to the 
	ontology 
TAIR - yes, it uses Gene Ontology and Plant Ontology - both are consortia so joining may allow contribution.	
wormbase - uses Gene Ontology, Anatomy Ontology (worm), and Phenotype Ontology (worm).  There does not seem to be a mechanism to 
	contribute.
  

If "yes":

2) Which ontologies are used?
3) What community related resources available for people seeking to use or contribute to the underlying ontology?  For example are there mailing lists, annotation guidelines, standards, or help wikis?

If "no":
 
4) How would this site benefit from the integration of an ontology?  Which specifically?

Bonus/other questions we asked, but you won't have time to cover:

1) How deeply did you have to dive into the site to discover that it uses an ontology? 
2) How often is the site updated with changes that reflect the current content of its backing ontologies?
3) How is logic in the ontology exploited in the site?
4) Are there clear routes to extracting ontology-related annotations/data from the site to, say, a CSV text file?
5) Does the organization of the underyling ontologies make a clear difference as to the functional benefits of the site?
6) Can you illustrate any apparent limits to functionality derived from logical inferernce across the ontology?  

== For Group Discusion == 

* Are ontologies ubiquitous in the day-to-day machinations of evolutionary biology?  Why or why not?
* Is it readily apparent that benefits/functionality are being derived from ontologies when they are being used?
* What is the site that best exemplifies ontology integration, why?
* Do sites that use ontologies serve large or small communities?  Are generalizations possible?
* [OTHERS]
