 Outstanding - Doe we want provide specific queries / site? Modify site list.  We have 1 hour, 5 minutes / site is >> 1 hr.  Are these the "most important" sites?
 Remember:  Karen will present open tree, and Jim will present Phensoscape KB

Start with slide with discussion of "Reference, Application, and Domain" ontologies. How are they mixed together? What is the mix called?  Does it matter?

Reference ontology - a data standard for building ontologies "all other classifications are useless"
   - strategies for modellings

= Ontologies, Evolution, and Web-based Resources =  

We have identified a number of different web-based portals, all of which have important usages for Evolutionary Biologists.  Some of these portals integrate/use ontologies, others do not.  

The goals of these exercises are the following:

* Raise awareness as to the sites themselves, and their potential use in evolutionary studies.
* Teach participants to identify when ontologies are being used.
* Illustrate mechanisms of integrating ontologies. 

== Sites ==

BHL: http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/
- is an ontology used anywhere?

Bioportal: bioportal.bioontology.org
- a triplestore/SPARQL

Dryad: http://datadryad.org/
- a hodgepodge of data - benefit from an ontology?
- biological database?
- purpose is a 

Flybase: http://flybase.org/ 
- tag their data, ontology used to retrieve data by tag 

Virtual Fly Brain: http://www.virtualflybrain.org
- uses same ontologys as Flybase - interface better integrated

GBIF: http://www.gbif.org/
- no ontology 

MGI: http://www.informatics.jax.org/
- has ontology 

Morphbank: http://morphbank.net
- no ontlogy

NIF: http://www.neuinfo.org/
- yes, have own ontology
- do explore this - aggregate hundreds of databases

OLS: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/
- all ontologies

Ontobee: www.ontobee.org
- use a triplestore

TAIR: http://www.arabidopsis.org/
- gene, plant ontology

ZFIN: http://zfin.org/
- yes 

Ontologies for Citations
- percentages of credit to authors
- BIBO
- VIVO / ISF
- Library/Marc
- Provo (Provenance ontology) -> data sources that publication/attribution (has a large community)

OpenContext

== Exercise ==

# For HALF of the sites above (choose based on your interest) consider the following questions.
In a text file, saved to your user SVN folder, answer the questions like so:

Ontobee: www.ontobee.org
1: yes/no
2: some answer
3: some answer
4: some answer
<you can also add answers to from the "bonus" questions if you choose>

Commit your file named 'audit.txt' to SVN when you have finished:

# !! After completion, find, and add your own site, with answers in the same format, to your text file.  
We will summarize the added sites this evening.

== Questions ==

1) Does this site use one or more ontologies?

If "yes":

2) Which ontologies are used?
3) What community related resources available for people seeking to use or contribute to the underlying ontology?  For example are there mailing lists, annotation guidelines, standards, or help wikis?

If "no":
 
4) How would this site benefit from the integration of an ontology?  Which specifically?

Bonus/other questions we asked, but you won't have time to cover:

1) How deeply did you have to dive into the site to discover that it uses an ontology? 
2) How often is the site updated with changes that reflect the current content of its backing ontologies?
3) How is logic in the ontology exploited in the site?
4) Are there clear routes to extracting ontology-related annotations/data from the site to, say, a CSV text file?
5) Does the organization of the underyling ontologies make a clear difference as to the functional benefits of the site?
6) Can you illustrate any apparent limits to functionality derived from logical inferernce across the ontology?  

== For Group Discusion == 

* Are ontologies ubiquitous in the day-to-day machinations of evolutionary biology?  Why or why not?
* Is it readily apparent that benefits/functionality are being derived from ontologies when they are being used?
* What is the site that best exemplifies ontology integration, why?
* Do sites that use ontologies serve large or small communities?  Are generalizations possible?

* [OTHERS]
