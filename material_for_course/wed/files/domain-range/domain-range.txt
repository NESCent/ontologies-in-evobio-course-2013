In this exercise we will illustrate how object properties can be used to subclassify classes that are restricted by them.

# Create a new ontology.
# Add the following class hierarchy (Hint: Try to cut and paste to enter the hierarchy into functionality you learned about previously):

depressor mandibulae muscle
leveator quadrati
muscle
nerve
  facial nerve
  trigeminal nerve

# Add the following:

* An object property named 'is_innervated_by'
* Add a domain on 'is_innervated_by' - 'muscle'
* To 'depressor mandibulae muscle' a subclass restriction "is innervated_by some 'facial nerve'"
* To 'leveator quadrati' a subclass restriction "is innervated_by some 'trigeminal nerve'"

Now run the reasoner and inspect the inferred class hierarchy.  What do you find?
