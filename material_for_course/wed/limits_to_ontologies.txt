= Limits to Ontologies = 

You've built an ontology, so you are (should be) planning to use the reasoning/inference that is possible.  What exactly can you do, and not do, and where might you have to plan to set asside time to reason with ontology?

Expressivity (evolutionary scientists works with complex data)

* OWL Profiles - http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-profiles/ 
* Open world assumptions (some head is shorter than some thorax, could be any head, not just the one in the species/speciemn of interest)
* Quantitative limits (?) 
* (?) Difficulties capturing multiple axes - can be done, but takes thinking - how to reason across time and sex ('show me all the males with blue heads that are 4 years old') 

Immediate (how are you slowed down within the immediate workbench you're utilizing)

* Even with a relatively simple ontology if you include individuals reasoning can be slow (Jim's family KB)
* If you instantiate a dataset, load it into Protege and reason over it, it will not necessarily tell you how a particular instance is causing a inconsistence.  {Derived from the bootstrapping names idea discussion with Jim}
* It's possible to add relatively few expressions (e.g. regex pattern) and significantly slow down reasoning process. 
* Many relatively important ontologies are large, try for example, to 'Open from URI' the NCBI Taxonomy ontology

Mid-long term

* You've made a set of semantic phenotypes and published them, where can they be deposited (so that they can be reasoned over by others, or further appended).
* Can you reason in real time over any reasonable sized set of data? Build times/memory requirements.
