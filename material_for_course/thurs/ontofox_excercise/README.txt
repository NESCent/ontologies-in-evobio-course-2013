INTERMEDIATE

Pre-requisites:

* Intro to OWL, Imports, OntoFox tutorial

Inputs:

* the empty_bfo.owl


Instructions:

# Use Ontofox to retrieve terms from external ontologies in order to extend the empty_bfo.owl ontology to include:
	# The tern 'epithelia cell' from CARO as subclass of 'Material Entity' 
	# The term 'single cell organism' from CARO as subclass of 'Material Entity' 
	# The term 'multicellular organism' from Uberon as subclass of 'Material Entity'
	# The term 'amoeba' as subclass of 'single cell organism' from NCBI Taxonomy
	# The term 'biological process' from GO as subclass of 'process'
	# The term  'localization' and all of its children as subclass of 'Biological process'

# Make sure that all imported terms have, when available, ONLY the following annotations: label, definition, preferred term and alternative term.
(The definition should ALWAYS be expressed using the IAO Annotation property http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115)

* You can use OntoBee or Bioportal to develop the most effective strategy to import terms in OntoFox

# The output of the exercise will include:
	1) A single OWL file that, when opened in Protege,  will show all the required classes 
	The IRI of this ontology will be: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/anatomy_course/ontofox_excercise.owl
	2) The OntoFox input files (.txt) used to generate the import files
	3) The import files (.owl) generated by OntoFox
	4) The catalog file

Extra Bonus:

Modify the the OntoFox input file for the NCBI Taxonomy term Amoeba in order to return  
all the parent classes up to Eukaryota as SubClasses of 'Material Entity'
Moreover, make sure to map the value of the rdfs:label to the Annotation property 'editor preferred term' in IAO.
Save the generated output file as ontofox_extra.owl and the new Ontofox input file in a separate folder
