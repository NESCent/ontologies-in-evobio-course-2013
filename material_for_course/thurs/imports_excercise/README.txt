BASIC

Pre-requisites:

* Intro to OWL and imports


Instructions:

# Open the caro_no_imports.owl file in Protege 
# Add the direct imports of the following owl files adding the files to the ontology library:
	# bfo.owl located at /caro_2/external/BFO2/bfo.owl
	# GO_imports.owl located at /caro_2/imports/GO_imports.owl
	# PATO_import.owl located at /caro_2/imports/PATO_import.owl
	
# Inspect the imported ontology panel
# Inspect the loaded ontolgy sources
	
# Inspect the catalog file with a text editor
	* What do you notice? Are the .owl files referenced with absolute or relative paths?


#Add the Information Artifact Ontology by importing it from the web:
	* the IRI of the ontology is the following: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/iao/ontology-metadata.owl

# Inspect the loaded ontology sources
	* What has changed? Hints: look for the magnifying lens

# Save the file as caro_2_new_imports_your_initials_here.owl 

# Create the directory 'manual_imports' on your machine (e.g. NOT in the SVN repository folder)

# Copy from the previous exercise the file caro_2_new_imports.owl (make sure you've saved it) under manual_imports/

# In Protege open the the caro_2_new_imports.owl

# Locate the missing imports

What has changed with respect to the first imports chain?
