=== Installing ===

See the link above.  In brief, you can install directly from within Protege (through Preferences, then the Plugins tab), or you can copy a plugin file (a .jar) to your plugins folder. 

That folder, in windows, is located somewhere like

c:/Program Files (x86)/Protege_4.3/plugins 

On a Mac it's in the applications folder, typically something like:

/Applications/Protege-4.3.app/Contents/Resources/Java/plugins

On a mac right-click->show package contents to navigate down into the plugins folder and drop the .jar flie into that folder.
