= Collaborative Editing =

In this exercise we're going to collaboratively edit a file to build a "pass it on" story.

* To start move back to your root of your svn repository, likely the "src" directory, and do 'svn up' to make sure you have the latest snapshot.
* In /user/shared find 'story.txt' and open it in your text editor.
* We'll take turns editing the the file.   When it is your turn, svn up to get the latest version, add a line, save the file, and commit it with

   svn ci -m '<your name> edits'

The instructors will then illustrate the following:

= Reverting = 

After a number of edits the editorial team has noticed the story has gone off the deep (PATO:0001596) end and needs to be returned to a prior state.

* The prior states can be viewed on the Google code site (illustrate link)
* They can also be checked out:

   svn up -r 4

Then committed back.

= Resolving conflicts = 

* What happens when too people edit the file in a conflicting way?  
* Illustrate by having two people commit at the same time

  svn resolved story.txt

* Point out svn resolve (theirs/yours)

= Advanced Topics =

- Given available time the instructors will go over these topics

- Gotchas - There are several:
  - API vs. filesystem
    ! copy, paste, rm
    - .svn files
    - corruption
 
- And time permitting (it won't):
  - Visualizing diffs using SmartSVN
  - Resolving conflicts
  - Branching/Tagging
  - Merging
  - Alternatives to SVN
